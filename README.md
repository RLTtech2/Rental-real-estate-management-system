# A web-based Rental House Management System
This is a web application for Rental House Management. It was originally designed for use in administrative reccords management in 2022, and was open to the public in 2024. The original version utilized SMS for communication and MPESA for payment.

Much has changed since its design to enhance its stability, security and performance. Not withstanding the changes, I believe that it still gives a solid foundation to anybody who is interested in learning the good old PHP and its application. It has instances for both imperative and OOP.
